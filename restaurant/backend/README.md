# backend of restaurant_sidechain
The backend of the luxury restaurant business based on Lisk blockchain is the responsible to perform any request to the sidechain blockchain. Also, it is responsible to receive requests from any client and perform transactions to the sidechain.
Restaurants can take advantage of RestaurantFood class and specify its restaurant lisk address on RestaurantInfo.js. For example: Restaurant 1 would have its food types, use the RestaurantFood class for its business and perform transactions to the same sidechain consumed by Restaurant 2. The difference is that Restaurant 2 can be a completely different restaurant business, it just need to specify its own restaurant lisk address on RestaurantInfo.js and peform a MenuTransaction to specify its food types with desserts, menu, entrances ...
